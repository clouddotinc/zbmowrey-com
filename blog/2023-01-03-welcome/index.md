This is the first post of my new Blog! As you can no doubt understand, I'm a little excited about it. The
blog is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), which is designed to make building documentation websites
ridiculously easy.

The learning curve is pretty shallow: 

    npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
    cd my-website
    npm start

Then you're off to the races! Writing Markdown (*.md) files makes it super easy to generate new pages and to
organize your thoughts, but Docusaurus runs deep. You can use MDX for a more interactive experience, or you
can write React components to take total control over the UI/UX. 

In any event, I like the overall layout and will definitely be adding tutorials and other docs to the library
side of this site. Whenever I complete a tutorial or have the lightbulb moment on some new technology, you can
expect an announcement here (and a library article for posterity).
