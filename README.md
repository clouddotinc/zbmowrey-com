# Website

This is my personal website, digital billboard, and link library. It's powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io).

### Installation
```
npm install
```

### Local Development
```
npm start
```
This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build
```
npm build
```
This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment
Merge changes to main and the rest happens magically. The site is deployed as a series of static HTML pages.
