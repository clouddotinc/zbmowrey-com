description: Career Goals / Desired Roles

# Introduction

My strength is my ability to learn. I can rapidly get up to speed on new technologies, using a broad understanding
of tech in general as leverage to quickly understand the key concepts and trade-offs inherent in new services.

## Types of Roles

I am interested in Cloud Architect/Software Architect roles at a Senior/Director level. Other roles which might
interest me would need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, but I'm open to having that conversation.

## Compensation - Ownership

Competitive base salary and benefits are more important to me than stock options, unless you're a publicly traded
company. That said, I'm not against talking with startups where a significant equity offer is on the table, assuming
the stars align on everything else. 

## Industries / Verticals

Please understand that I presently have no desire to work for companies in a marketing space: call centers, email
marketing, affiliate marketing, and other companies of a similar nature are not where I want to spend my time.

It might pique my interest if you wanted me to work somewhere really cool, like video gaming, media (tv/movies),
blockchain/crypto, or in the machine learning/AI space. 

## Challenging But Achievable

I have a preference for a role which will challenge me to grow in new directions, presenting a constant stream of new
ideas and technologies, and require considered judgement of each. The pace of work should be brisk without threatening
burnout. A clear work pipeline is **highly** desirable. 

## Remote-First with Occasional Travel

I've enjoyed the lack of a daily commute more than can be expressed in a paragraph. My productivity levels are high,
my employer engagement is stellar, and my family enjoys having me around for that extra 2-3 hours per day that I'd
otherwise have spent driving. 

I'm not opposed to occasional travel in support of a business purpose, but driving into an office on a regular basis 
is not something I'm willing to consider at this time. Likewise, relocation is out of the picture for now.
