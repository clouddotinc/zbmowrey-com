# Introduction

My strength is my ability to learn. I can rapidly get up to speed on new technologies, using a broad understanding
of tech in general as leverage to quickly understand the key concepts and trade-offs inherent in new services. I
am a strong communicator with a passion for teaching and mentoring; my ability to distill complex topics into
simple, understandable language has been a key factor in my success.

## Types of Roles

I'm open to a variety of opportunities, including:

- Leadership / Management Roles in Engineering, Cloud Operations, or DevOps
- Solutions Architect / Cloud Architect / Software Architect
- DevOps Engineer / Cloud Engineer (at a Senior or Lead level)

## Challenging But Achievable

I have a preference for a role which will challenge me to grow in new directions, presenting a constant stream of new
ideas and technologies, and require considered judgement of each. The pace of work should be brisk without threatening
burnout. A clear work pipeline is **highly** desirable.

## Industries / Verticals

It might pique my interest if you wanted me to work somewhere really cool, like video gaming, media (tv/movies),
blockchain/crypto, or in the machine learning/AI space. As an alternative to that, working for a company which
builds the tools others use to make their products would be interesting as well.

## Remote-First with Occasional Travel

I've enjoyed the lack of a daily commute more than can be expressed in a paragraph. My productivity levels are high,
my employer engagement is stellar, and my family enjoys having me around for that extra 2-3 hours per day that I'd
otherwise have spent driving.

- Open to occasional travel (all-hands events, team-building, etc.)
- Not open to relocation
- Not open to in-office or hybrid roles

I live in US Eastern Time (UTC-5) and would prefer to work these hours, but I can be flexible for the right
company, role, and team.
