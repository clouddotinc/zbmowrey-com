# Introduction

## Types of Roles

My strength is my ability to learn. I can rapidly get up to speed on new technologies, using a broad understanding
of tech in general as leverage to quickly understand the key concepts and trade-offs inherent in new services. To
that end, a role in software or cloud architecture just feels right.

## Challenging But Achievable

I have a preference for a role which will challenge me to grow in new directions, presenting a constant stream of new
ideas and technologies, and require considered judgement of each. The pace of work should be brisk without threatening
burnout. A clear work pipeline is highly desirable. 

## Remote-First with Occasional Travel

I've enjoyed the lack of a daily commute more than can be expressed in a paragraph. My productivity levels are high,
my employer engagement is stellar, and my family enjoys having me around for that extra 2-3 hours per day that I'd
otherwise have spent driving. 

That said, I'm not opposed to occasional travel in support of a business purpose.  

## Seniority Level

I'm willing to consider roles at the senior manager or director level which would put my experience to good use. My
aspiration is to participate at a high level (director, VP, C-suite) with a company which can offer strong compensation, 
significant ownership opportunity, and a mission which resonates with me. Growing into such a role is not out of the
question.
