# Education

## University/College

### Bachelor of Science in Cloud Computing

Bachelor's in Science / Cloud Computing 
Western Governor's University, Salt Lake City UT  
Dates: 2020-2023  
GPA: 3.0

### Cisco Certified Network Associate (OCC)

I took a night course for 4 semesters to learn the ins and outs of networking. The
course was greatly enjoyable, and fortunately for me subnetting and cabling hasn't 
really evolved in the last 20 years. ðŸ™‚

Olney Central College, Olney IL  
Dates: 2000-2002    
GPA: 4.0

## Certifications

Certifications alone aren't proof of skill or experience, but they give me a clear path to develop
a baseline level of skill in a given topic. As a natural test taker, I enjoy the challenge and the
reward when I see "Passed" on the screen... almost as much as I enjoy the new knowledge I've
accumulated.
