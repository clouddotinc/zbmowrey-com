# Start Here

The idea of an **Awesome List** isn't new, I know. There are entire GitHub Repositories full of lists, and I'm
equally sure those are better maintained. So why am I doing this? 

Personal reference. Those lists are massive and just to scroll through them to find things can take an Age. So
this part of my site is dedicated to a subset of awesomeness: those projects or links I found personally interesting
and/or have implemented in some fashion. 

By archiving them here, I can more quickly reference the things I've done or dealt with or found interesting, without
having to wade through 500 lines of stuff that (while still awesome) didn't necessarily get my attention.
