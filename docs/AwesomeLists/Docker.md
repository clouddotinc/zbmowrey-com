# Docker

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a 
standardized unit for software development. Docker containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run an 
application, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. Docker containers
are portable and can run on any Linux or Windows machine.

The use of Docker has dramatically improved the development and deployment of applications. From simplified onboarding
to knowing that your developed image is going to run the same way across environments, Docker has become a staple in
the development world.


## My Favorite Docker Training

- [Docker Mastery: The Complete Toolset From a Docker Captain](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-mastery/) - This
  course is a great introduction to Docker. It covers the basics of Docker, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm. It also
  covers some of the more advanced topics like Docker Networking, Docker Security, and Docker Orchestration. The course
  is around 10 hours long and is taught by Bret Fisher, a Docker Captain and Docker Certified Trainer.

## Awesome Docker Containers

- LinuxServer.io - LinuxServer.io is a collection of Docker images for popular applications. They are well maintained
  and well documented. They also have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/YWrKVTn) server where you can get help with
  their images. You can find a full list of their images [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver).

- Portainer - Portainer is a lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your Docker host or Swarm
  cluster. It allows you to manage your containers, images, volumes, networks and more! It is a free, open-source
  tool that runs as a Docker container on your Docker host. You can find it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/portainer/portainer).

- Watchtower - Watchtower is a process for automating Docker container base image updates. It will monitor the
  Docker Hub for updated images and when one is found, it will automatically update the container. You can find it
  on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/v2tec/watchtower).
