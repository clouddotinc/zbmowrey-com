# Awesome AI/ML

## Chat GPT

_Caution: This thing can be "confidently wrong" and is very persuasive. While this is (in my experience) relatively
rare, you should verify what it says before reporting it as fact or relying on it in any important way._ 

This is the "Google Killer" chatbot everyone's been talking about. It's currently in a free research stage, but is 
widely expected to begin charging an access fee at some point. Working with it seems like living in the future, as
it responds and adapts to successive requests. 

Try, for example: 

    "Can you write a short explanation of how black holes work?"

...followed by...

    "Can you make that explanation 500 words long?"

Watch as it responds, using your initial prompt and its response to you, then adapting it to the new request.

This Discord Bot will generate complex, from-scratch images based on your text descriptions. It has a very shallow
learning curve, and has created some pretty spectacular art. Its use is controversial as artists and their supporters
rally against it. 

Where do we draw the lines in what constitutes "derivative work"? Does a model trained on millions of images on public
websites owe anything to the creators of those images? I feel certain that this particular aspect of AI/ML is not yet
settled. The legal future is in question, but for now, the tool is available and is enabling a massive new population 
to create digital art. 

Try:
