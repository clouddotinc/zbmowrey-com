# More Than Certified in Terraform

[This Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-certified) helped me when I was getting started.
The course was around 8 hours long and divided into 2 parts: the first half centers on a local Docker
install, where you're creating, uploading, and deleting containers using Terraform to get comfortable
with the HCL language and its concepts. The second half is a bit more advanced, where you're creating
a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Terraform. 

Note: You should never really pay full price for a Udemy course. They are constantly offering discounts
and there are plenty of coupon codes floating around the internet. A cursory Google search should turn
up a nice discount for you.
