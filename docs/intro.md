# Welcome

I'm a technology enthusiast with more than 20 years' experience in the field. As a Cloud Software Architect,
I gather requirements from business leaders and translate those into the arcane symbols required by Engineers.
My interests and hobbies are mostly tech-focused, but I also enjoy traveling with my family and pointing out that
it's not cold in Florida.

## What's out of Scope? 

The traditionally inflammatory topics are off limits: politics, religion, cultural norms, current events, etc. 

My intent is to make this a reference library, not a blog.
