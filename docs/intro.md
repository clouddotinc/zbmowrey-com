# Welcome

Hi,

I'm Zach. I'm a technology enthusiast with more than 20 years' experience in the field. As a Cloud Software Architect,
I gather requirements from business leaders and translate those into the arcane symbols required by Engineers.
My interests and hobbies are mostly tech-focused, but I also enjoy traveling with my family and pointing out that
it's not cold in Florida.

I hope you find something of interest here. I am very open to feedback, including but not limited to requests for
new content of some sort, requests that I clarify or rewrite something to make more sense, corrections on technical
points, or whatever else you might want to say. 

## What You'll Find Here

### Biographical Detail

- My Resume
- Hobbies & Projects

### Technical Library

- Tutorials
- Guides
- Walk-Throughs
- Demos
- Awesome Lists
- Reference Works

## What's out of Scope? 

The traditionally inflammatory topics are off limits: politics, religion, cultural norms, current events, etc. 
My intent is to make this a reference library, not a blog.
