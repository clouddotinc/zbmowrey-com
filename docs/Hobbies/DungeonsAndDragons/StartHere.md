# Start Here

Why do I find enjoyment in this game? Growing up, I fell in love with books. Reading became my escape mechanism. I
wanted to be an author when I grew up, and my preferred genre was most definitely fantasy. In short, I really love a 
good story. 

D&D offers what is potentially the greatest interactive story possible. Of course, this all heavily depends on the
people at the table, but when it works, nothing beats it. You're piloting a character through a complex series of 
challenges, bringing a personality to life, but it's not just "I do this, and it works"... the dice have something
to say about your chances of success, so there's always some reasonable chance to fail. 

This creates the dramatic tension necessary for a plot to really work. No one wants to read a novel about a hero who
faces no adversity. We want things to go wrong, so the hero can overcome and grow. With D&D, we can get that regularly.

Now, layer in on top of this story & plot love... one last element: socializing with friends. I have laughed, I have
cried, and I have enjoyed years of friendship at the gaming table. That's worth the price of admission, whatever it
might be. 

The rest of this section is more of a set of notes to myself than anything else. I might drop some character build
ideas, class/feat combinations I find interesting, etc. I make no promises it'll be entertaining to you, but with 
any luck you'll get some value out of it.
