This webapp has been incredibly helpful in unifying the source materials, generating and tracking characters, and
otherwise saving some erasers from a lifetime of punishment. While there are potential costs, they're relatively
easy to bear: 

* Access to the site/app are free.
* Players without a subscription can create a handful of characters free of charge.
* Books and source materials require a one-time payment.
* If one of the players in a campaign has a paid subscription, players can share content in that campaign. 

I find the phone app to be useful for quickly finding a rule and for managing my spell slots. Doing much else is
easier to handle on paper, then I update the app after a session. I try not to spend time staring at a screen when
my friends are at the table.
