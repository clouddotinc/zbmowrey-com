# Desktop

I prefer working on a desktop computer; if your company requires the use of company-managed hardware,
I can work with that (especially if RDP is an allowable option). 

My primary environment is Windows 11, but I use WSL 2 all day every day for development work. 

## Docker

I prefer my applications to be containerized, with configurations governed by version control (using
docker-compose). Local development environments should mirror production as closely as possible, and
containers are the best way to ensure that happens.

## Software

I'm hooked on JetBrains products, and will lean into IDEs which are specific to the project being
built. I'm proficient with Datagrip, Pycharm, and PHPStorm, but all others are easy to pick up 
since they have a lot in common across products.

In addition to the IDEs and working environment, I'm absolutely comfortable using most of the
Microsoft Office suite, Lucid Charts or Visio, and any given chat clients you might care to list.

I have a very slight preference for using GitHub as my primary source control platform, but have
used and am familiar with Gitlab. In both cases, I'm comfortable building CI/CD pipelines using
their respective tools (Gitlab CI, GitHub Actions).

## IAC

I can work with CloudFormation in AWS, but I have a strong preference for Terraform (preferring
HCL over CDK, as I believe templates should be more declarative than imperative and simple to
intuit). I'm experienced at building Terraform stacks and modules and integrating those into
version control with static analysis tools like KICS. I'm a HashiCorp Certified Implementation
Partner (trained in deploying and managing Terraform Cloud), and Certified Terraform Associate.
