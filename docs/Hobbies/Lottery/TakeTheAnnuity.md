# Summary 

When, not if, you win a life-changing sum of lottery money, you will have a decision to make. Do you trust the
government to pay you consistently for 25 years? Or would you rather take half the money right now? 

Under almost every set of circumstances, you will choose the lump sum. And every time you do, you'll be wrong. 

## Why? 

The lump sum is going to clock in at around 50% of the advertised jackpot. So you won $500M? No, you didn't. See below:

| Strategy | Jackpot | Pre-Tax Payout | After-Taxes |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Lump Sum | $500M   | $250M          | $150M       |
| Annuity  | $500M   | $500M          | $300M       |

## But Can't I Make More With the Lump Sum?

So, could you double your money in 25 years? Absolutely! It would only take: 

1. Not spending a dime of the lump sum.
2. 5% average return on investment (you pay taxes, so end up with 3% each year to save). 
3. Not spending a dime of those earnings until you hit year 25. 

You could, of course, spend some of that sweet money, if you can rack up a higher return on investment. Which, 
historically, is doable. If you surround yourself with the right people and make prudent financial decisions.
Does that describe you? 

## Easy Mode

Alternatively, you select the annuity and cruise to an easy $300M over 25 years. Which, by the way, is a post-tax
number. Hopefully you're smart enough to put away 50% each year. That means you get to spend $6M a year every year
and at year 25 when the annuity stops, you've *contributed* $150M to an investment fund. 

## Retired Forever

At the same 5% return on investment (step 2 above), your fund should have hit $230M by year 25, which will let you
pull around $7M a year in personal income (after taxes)... _forever_. 

Yes, I just presented you with a plan that starts at $6M a year and ends with you living for a hundred more years,
and making $7M in after-tax interest. You think you could be comfortable on that? 

## But Hyperinflation? 

No. Understand that when you're playing in this league, you're not sitting on cash. You're invested in stocks, 
bonds, real estate, commodities, and much more. You're diversified. You rise with the tide. Inflation might make
breakfast more expensive, but your houses and art are going up in value, too. 

## Are there any exceptions? 

I haven't found them. The only circumstance (and I do here mean only) is if you intend to die before the annuity
completes. In most states, the state is under no obligation to pay your descendants the remaining annuity. 

Under every other form of calculation, the annuity will win over a long enough time frame, given equal conditions
to the lump sum. And that doesn't take into account the natural friction an annuity would impose on your spending, 
preventing you from buying a $100M boat.
