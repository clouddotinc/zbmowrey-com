# What Would You Do? 

Everybody has an idea, a plan, some concept of how they'd spend ridiculous amounts of unearned money. For a large
portion of those people, the amount of thought that goes into it falls far short of what might be required to hang
for dear life as your money swirls the drain. 

Not me. No, indeed. I have given this more thought than it deserves. 

## So, Why? 

Because I sometimes find myself very bored, and am stuck with an analytical mind. The appealing thought of winning
a mega-massive super whatsit-ball Jackpot gives me a way to pass the time and work through a mind puzzle of sorts.
There are calculations to be made, and there is research to be done. Costs must be estimated, damn it! How would I
pay the tax bill? Do we hire a nanny? How many bodyguards is "too many"? 

These unending questions demanded attention. And so I put forth the effort.

## You're Not Addicted, Are You? 

No. My total (grand total, no hidden charges) lottery spend in 2022 was $10. If I notice a jackpot is starting to
get excessive, I'll buy a ticket or two, but I'm not pinning my hopes and dreams on being whisked down a runway to
the state lottery office. This is just a fun way for me to plot world domination and kill a couple of hours in the
doing... which makes the time:entertainment value come out in my favor more often than not.

## Is this your actual plan? 

Heavens, no. My actual plan is mind-numbingly boring to anyone but me. I made sure of that. You can confirm with
my family, who would benefit the most and who express near-zero interest. Eyes glaze over. Exits are scanned for
a way out. I understand their reluctance to engage on this topic, but it is what it is. 

This is, rather, the set of guiding principles I've distilled from hundreds of hours of consideration and care. 
Take from it what you will, or leave it to gather dust... it'll only really matter if I win.
